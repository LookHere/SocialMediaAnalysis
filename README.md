# SocialMediaAnalysis
<i> This projects uses social media in an attempt to find HR insights. </i>

Organizations can have people working in different specializations.  Creating a job description for each role helps organize the workforce.  This is often decided based on what the employee is doing (marketing, engineering, etc.) and their level (manager, director, etc.).  A good job descriptions can be used as the foundation of organization design, compensation, and recruiting processes. 

This exercise analyzes public job descriptions from multiple organizations to find similarities and differences.  Since the Human Resources division is generally responsible for writing the job descriptions, this exercise began by focusing on job descriptions of Human Resources positions (since HR should understand roles on their own team the most).  Since higher level positions often get more focus, this project focused on the top level HR position irrespective of its title (Head of People, Chief People Officer, Global Head of Talent Management, etc.).  Remote job descriptions were chosen to limit any bias in a specific geography.  Company size was generally over 75 employees (since below that this role is often an individual contributor) and 750 (since above that role are often handled through an employment agency, not posted publicly online.   The job descriptions were taking in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarter of 2022 to avoid influences of major COVID lock-downs or pre-COVID norms.
